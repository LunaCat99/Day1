<h2><i>Everett Community  College - GRAPH 130</i></h2></br>

<h3>How many quarters have you attended EvCC?</h3>
<p>This is my 6<sup>th</sup> quater at EvCC. I started Fall Qtr of 2022.</p></br>

<h3>What degree/certificate program are you pursuing?</h3>
<p>I am currently working on a transfer degree in both studio arts and graphic design. My hope is to transfer to Western Washington to
	continue pursuing both careers.</p></br>

<h3>Why did you choose this degree/certificate?</h3>
<p>I was originally going to school for psychology and sociology but due to life circumstances I had to quit school. Then in 2020 when I was
	getting ready to start again the pandemic happened. Because of that I had a lot of time to think if I really wanted to go to school for 
	that again or something else. I had always wanted to study art as a kid but coming from a poor and immigrant background, I had a lot of
	pressure to choose something realistic so I wouldn't be wasting my families money. But the pandemic makes you realize just how quickly 
	we can disappear from this world and I didn't want to have spent whatever life I had doing something I didn't love. So, I chose to come
	back to study art. And I'm glad I did.</p></br>

<h3>What artist/designer inspires you? Why?</h3>
<p>I don't have particular artists or designers that I follow. I usually search and keep up on styles that I'm particularly fond of such as
	kawaii designs or vintage lettering. Right now I have been following "Janey Illustrations" on TikTok. She is a printmaker and art teacher
	who works out of a makeshift studio in her living room.</p></br>

<h3>What is your favorite color?</h3>
<p style="color:#B24C6D;"> My favorite color is anything pink or purple really, particularly a nice mauve color.</p>
